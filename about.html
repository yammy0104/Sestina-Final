      <div class = "goal">Goal</div>
      <p>This is a project combining my webart knowledge with my poem experience in this semester.
         I got to know this Sestina in my poetry class, and was very impressed by the overall atmosphere it brought to me.
       It is transquil, lonely but very beautiful.
       The reoccuring emphasis on "time" and "home" is further strengthed by the progressively shortened format.
      Therefore, I want to make a webpage to present the beauty of this poem.
      The goal of this webpage is to inmitate the texture of a book, while giving the visitors a sense of lonesome and peace.
